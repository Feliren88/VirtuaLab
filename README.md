## Inspiration

The awakening of the recent COVID-19 pandemic has crippled multiple sectors that are essential parts of living. One of such sectors is the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education industry. In light of this event, students, teachers and researchers alike have been denied access to their so-called ‘Garden of Eden’ that is crucial to them, their laboratories. The term ‘Work from home’ has now taken precedence and although this has made living and working somewhat manageable for some, we could not say the same for others, especially those in STEM. Being tethered to the internet and online resources alone is not meeting all the requirements of the members of STEM, such as the need for a full-blown laboratory.

We noticed that this issue was evident in our alma mater, Monash University and decided to investigate further by conducting questionnaires in the form of a survey. In respect to Garuda Hacks, we narrowed our demographic to Indonesians pursuing tertiary education locally and abroad. Some of the key problems faced by our demographic:
- Conducting laboratory experiments may require costly equipment and apparatuses (e.g. platinum electrodes in electrolysis).
- Certain laboratory experiments may be dangerous, especially those involving materials that are corrosive, explosive, radioactive, etc.
- Radioactive materials are also expensive and may need to be replaced from time to time (depending on the half-life of the materials concerned – some such as iodine-131 has a half-life of a few minutes, meaning that they have to be replaced often).
- Storing hazardous materials may be costly.
- Not all schools/educational institutions have access to laboratories or laboratory equipment, especially in rural areas given the high cost of setting up and maintaining a laboratory. These include licensing issues as well.
- Certain schools may not store or use laboratory equipment properly and may lead to some form of damage (e.g. contaminated chemicals, zero-errors on measuring equipment etc.).
- Laboratory equipment may be outdated. Although in certain places school curricula may also be similarly outdated, this can potentially cause problems if the curricula is updated.
- Although not fundamental to the experiments itself, some students may find it uncomfortable to work in the laboratory due to malfunctioning air conditioning or projectors.
The need for the presence of a qualified laboratory technician at all times also seems to be an influencing factor.
